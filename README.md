# iOS Activity Data

## Goal
Explore relationships between iOS activity data (step count and device usage) using data extracted from local backups.

## Status
Early exploration. Step count data extraction and schema inspection in progress. Screen Time data feasibility still under investigation.

## Working Notes
- 2025-12-25: Created repository and decided to perform analysis in R.
- 2025-12-27: Cloned repository locally and edited README from local environment to test git.
- 2025-12-27: Configured GitHub authentication via GitHub CLI (gh); HTTPS pushes now work without password prompts.

## Open Questions
- What tool am I using to extract step and screen data.

## Milestones
- 2025-12-27: Health data extraction + schema discovery complete (see notes/healthdb-schema-discovery.md)
